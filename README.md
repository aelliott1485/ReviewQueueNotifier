# User Script

##This is a script for the Stack Exchange Network

This script will make it so that you are notified on the Desktop whenever new reviews are available, as long as you have a review tab open.

##How to use
- Install [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) (Firefox) or [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome). These are userscript managers and allow the script to make use of `GM_*` functions
- Install the script: <kbd>[install](https://github.com/malachi26/ReviewQueueNotifier/raw/master/UserScript/ReviewQueueNotification.user.js)</kbd> or <kbd>[view source](https://github.com/malachi26/ReviewQueueNotifier/blob/master/UserScript/ReviewQueueNotification.user.js)</kbd>
- Any time you have a review queue window open, the script will run and alert you anytime there are reviews to be performed.

##Notes
- Feel free to post issues to the GitHub repository, contributors actively watch for issues and will work on solving them ASAP!
- If you have time and would like to get involved, check out the issues list.

I altered a [zomis][2] script to create this version, [check out his Moderator version][3].

##Updates

###Version 2.1.1

- Fixes issue where no notification would show up when using GreaseMonkey on Firefox-derived browsers.

###Version 3.0.1 Next

- Review Queue Page opens when the notification is clicked and the notification disappears
- ??

### Future Enhancements 

- Possibly showing seperate notification for each queue on the review page, so that the user knows which one has reviews in it
- Turning off specific queues
- ??
